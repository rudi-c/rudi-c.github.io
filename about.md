My name is Rudi, currently a full-time software engineer at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (we're [hiring](https://jobs.lever.co/figma?lever-via=6zOWcEa37l)!). I work on design editor features, stability, and the plugin API.

Previously, I finished a degree in Computer Science at University of Waterloo. I have interned at Airbnb, Jane Street, Dropbox and Side Effects Software and was in the Recurse Center Summer 1 '17 batch. In this blog, I try to put words together in sentences such that they may be interesting and occasionally useful.
