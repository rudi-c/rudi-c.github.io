My name is Rudi, currently a full-time software engineer at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (we're [hiring](https://www.figma.com/careers/)!) based in NYC. I've worked on variety of areas including the design editor, product features, stability, frontend web infrastructure, the plugin API, [real-time data infrastructure](https://www.figma.com/blog/livegraph-real-time-data-fetching-at-figma/).

Previously, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science at University of Waterloo. I have interned at Airbnb, Jane Street, Dropbox and Side Effects Software and was in the Recurse Center Summer 1 '17 batch. In this blog, I try to put words together in sentences such that they may be interesting and occasionally useful.
